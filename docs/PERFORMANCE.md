# Performance Goals

- Symbolic consistency: Agents maintain coherent traits across cycles
- Diversity of execution: Avoids repetitive behaviors (loop warnings)
- Adaptiveness: Supervisor detects failures and enforces corrective strategies
- Predictive alignment: Simulator enhances symbolic diversity and optimization
- Narrative clarity: Self-narratives align with agent trajectory and system status
